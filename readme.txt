[include image of architecture]

Requirements: Linux, Anaconda, sox, opensmile-2.3.0, pytorch v?

This is the code for the papers: 
	blabla [link]

The supplied code is designed to reproduce the main results from [icmi paper] that show the utility of using the multiscale approach. The code can potentially be adapted used to reproduce other results from both papers. It can also be used to investigate other user-defined feature-sets and architectures. I hope it is useful! Please feel free to contact me if you find any errors or have any queries. It is still a work in progress.
